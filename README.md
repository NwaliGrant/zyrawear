## 🖤 Rooted in Culture

At Zyrawear, we honour African craftsmanship like the **Akwàete cloth** — a handwoven fabric from Akwete town in Abia State, Nigeria. Traditionally woven by women and worn by men and women during cultural events, it remains a proud symbol of heritage. We bring this legacy to life through digital fashion.
